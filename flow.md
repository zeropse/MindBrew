- **Responsiveness:** Design the app to work well on different screen sizes (desktops, tablets, smartphones).
- **Performance:** Optimize the app for speed and efficiency (e.g., by caching quotes, using efficient data fetching techniques).
- **Analytics:** Track user behavior (e.g., which topics are most popular, which quotes are shared most often) to improve the app over time.
- **Backend:** Consider using a database to store quotes and topics. Design an API to serve quotes to the front-end.
